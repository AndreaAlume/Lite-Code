# Lite-Code

## Description

Lite Code lets you code smarter, not harder — combining blazing-fast performance and minimal resource usage with a modern, intuitive interface you'll love.

The **target audience** consists of expert programmers with strong knowledge and experience, as well as coders who want full control behind the scenes and have the ability to fully configure their projects

## Features

In this section, I’ll describe the features I plan to implement for this project and highlight the main functional areas.

### 1. File Explorer

I’d like to add a section where users can browse folders and view files, featuring drag-and-drop support and icons to enhance visual clarity. Additionally, you’ll be able to create, delete, and rename both folders and files.

- #### 1.1 Find a folder or file
    I want to include a section that allows users to find their folders or files by typing the name, or to filter them by file extension.

- #### 1.2 Auto-save mode
    Users have the option to configure the auto-save feature, enabling or disabling it as needed.
